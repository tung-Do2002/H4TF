## Data Transformation
- **Missing Values**: Addressed missing values primarily due to market closures on weekends and holidays.
- **Data Types**: Converted data types appropriately (e.g., `Date` to `datetime`, and price-related columns to float).
- **Data Integrity**: Verified no duplicate dates in this time-series dataset, resulting in a dataset of 1,308 rows and 6 columns.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
- Analyzed market conditions, observing two price peaks and their alignment with industry growth in 2020-2021.
- Examined patterns in **Open Price**, **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**, and **Moving Average (MA)** to understand underlying market trends.
- Applied **Quarterly Comparison** to detect significant variances in price and trading volume.

## Feature Engineering
Selected **Price** as the primary feature for prediction based on its high correlation with other price-related variables and low correlation with volume, ensuring optimal model focus.

## Modeling
### ARIMA Model

1. **Stationarity Check**: Utilized the Dickey-Fuller test and differencing to achieve stationarity.
2. **ACF & PACF Analysis**: Guided ARIMA parameter selection through autocorrelation insights.
3. **Model Selection**: Identified an optimal ARIMA(2, 1, 0) model with the lowest AIC of -6116.61.

### LSTM Model

1. **Data Normalization**: Normalized price data to enhance training performance.
2. **Sequence Creation**: Structured time series sequences for both training and testing.
3. **Architecture**: Built a deep learning model with two LSTM layers and Dense layers, trained for 1 epoch.

### Model Comparison
| Metric       | ARIMA   | LSTM         |
|--------------|---------|--------------|
| **MAE**      | 0.0243  | 1181.5377    |
| **RMSE**     | 0.0326  | 1440.2883    |
| **RÂ² Score** | 0.9638  | 0.7185       |

## Results
The **ARIMA model** demonstrated superior accuracy and lower error magnitudes compared to the LSTM model, making it a more reliable choice for short-term forecasting in this dataset.

## Conclusion
The ARIMA model provides an effective approach for short-term predictions, though further refinements are necessary for longer-term reliability. This analysis underscores the importance of using robust statistical methods for accurate stock price predictions in volatile markets.
